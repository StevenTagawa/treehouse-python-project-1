# treehouse-python-project-1
This is Project 1 for the Treehouse Python Techdegree.

The script takes an input file containing data on children who have signed up to play soccer, and divides them as evenly as possible between a number of teams.  It also divides those children who have prior experience as evenly as possible between the teams.  The input file contains data on 18 children, 9 of whom are experienced.  The number of teams is hard-coded (per the project instructions) at three.  However, the script is capable of handling any number of children and/or teams.

The output from the script is a text file containing the roster list for each team, along with each child's information.  The script also generates files containing a letter to each child's guardian(s), with the name of the team their child is playing for, and the date of the first practice.

The script error-checks all incoming data and aborts with an appropriate error if invalid data is found.
